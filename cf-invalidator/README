these scripts were written to automating invalidating 600,000 paths in
cloudfront.

You start with a file containing the filenames; invalidation_filenames.txt

You run the ./splitter to chop it up into batches of 1000 (cloudfront will only
	do 1000 at a time)

You run the ./invalidater.py in a screen session or something and let it go. It
	will take a while (for the 600,000 it took like 30hrs).
